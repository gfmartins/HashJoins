### Hash Joins

Implementation of modern Hash Join algorithms in C++.
The implementation includes:

* No partitioning join (single threaded)
* Single pass radix join (single threaded)
* No partitioning join (multi threaded)
* Radix join (multi threaded)

Written for the seminar "Implementation Techniques for Main Memory Databases"
during the winter term 2018/2019.

### TODO in the future
* Refactor HashTable code for DRY principle
* Improve Code-Reuse between different Classes
